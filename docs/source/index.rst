Welcome to guiml's documentation!
=================================

.. warning::

   Guiml is still in early development. The current state is only a proof of
   concept. The described concepts should work in principle, but it is likely
   that you will encounter cryptic error messages or undefined/ unintended
   behavior. Additionally, a lot of corner cases are probably not dealt with
   correctly. Applications are also likely to suffer from performance issues,
   as the code is not optimized at all.
